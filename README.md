# Springboard_Sep_Month_QC-Variance_Board_using_Power_BI

### *Project Description*

#### *Summary*  
I developed a Power BI dashboard titled *"Spring Board Sep Month QC Variance Board"*, providing detailed insights into Quality Control (QC) and backlog management. The dashboard spans six interactive pages, integrating KPIs, mapping, advanced visualizations, and filters to enable data-driven decision-making. By leveraging DAX queries, it delivers customized analytics, focusing on performance tracking, quality checks, deliveries, and backlogs across customer locations and timeframes. This dashboard enhances operational efficiency by presenting actionable insights and streamlining QC performance monitoring.

#### *Key Insights*  
1. *Interactive Navigation and KPIs*: The first page includes navigation buttons and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Quality Checked, Backlogs, Delivered, and Unique Customers. It also features a mapping of customer locations, along with filters for processes, jobs, and dates, providing an easy-to-navigate interface for quick access to critical data.  
2. *Data Analysis and Performance Metrics*: Page 2 showcases a table with essential data, while cards display key values for delivered, quality checked, and backlog items. Filters are applied based on delivery status, developed with DAX queries for condition-based analysis and precise insights into delivered percentage performance.  
3. *QC vs Delivered*: Page 3 presents visual insights on QC performance, including a top 10 QC delivered customer chart in bar form, location-based QC delivered data in a stacked bar chart, a QC delivered gauge meter, and a donut chart for QC delivered analysis. These visualizations allow users to easily compare and track QC performance.  
4. *Delivered vs Backlogs*: Page 4 focuses on performance rankings, displaying rankings of delivered items based on managers at Spring Board, as well as the backlog data categorized by managers. This provides a clear overview of delivery vs. backlog status, enhancing managerial accountability and driving performance improvements.  
5. *Date-Wise Analysis*: Page 5 offers date-wise analysis of quality checked sums, QC, and backlog errors, presented in an area chart. This feature helps users track trends over time and pinpoint specific dates where issues arose, providing insights for more efficient date-based decision-making.  
6. *QA and Decomposition Tree*: The final page (Page 6) utilizes a QA decomposition tree to break down the data further, providing users with deeper insights into the root causes of issues and QC performance. This feature helps in identifying patterns and anomalies in the data, supporting continuous improvement.

#### *Key Benefits*  
The *Spring Board Sep Month QC Variance Board* dashboard integrates critical performance data and empowers users to:  
- Track and evaluate QC performance and backlog status in real-time.  
- Analyze customer data by location, process, job, and delivery status with interactive filters.  
- Monitor QC vs. Delivered and Backlog rankings by managers to improve accountability.  
- Access detailed date-wise trends and breakdowns for precise operational insights.  
- Use a decomposition tree to analyze and resolve underlying QC issues for improvement.

#### *Tools and Technologies Used*  
- **Power BI Desktop**: For creating dynamic, interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **DAX**: For developing custom calculations and condition-based analysis, improving data accuracy.  
- **Data Visualization Techniques**: To design comprehensive charts, graphs, and visuals for clear performance monitoring.  
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: For efficient data processing and integration within the dashboard.

This project highlights how Power BI can streamline QC performance tracking and backlog management. By integrating advanced visualizations, customized filtering, and DAX-based calculations, the dashboard allows organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions and improve operational processes effectively.
